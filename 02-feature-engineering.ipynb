    "In notebook 01-eda.ipynb we explored our data, Exploring the data is a vital part of the data science workflow - it's important to understand what information the data holds and get a sense, early on, as to whether or not the data will be sufficient to provide insights into the question at hand. In our case, this question is 'can we determine if a female patient has diabetes'.\n",
